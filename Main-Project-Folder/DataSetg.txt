Doctor: Good morning! How are you feeling today?
Patient: Good morning, Doctor. I'm feeling much better than last time.
Doctor: That’s great to hear. Any pain or discomfort?
Patient: No, just a little tired sometimes.
Doctor: That’s normal. Are you taking your medicines regularly?
Patient: Yes, I haven’t missed a dose.
Doctor: Good. Let me check your vitals quickly. (checks vitals) Everything looks fine.
Patient: That’s a relief.
Doctor: Keep following the same routine, and try to get enough rest.
Patient: Sure, Doctor. Thank you.
Doctor: You're welcome. I’ll see you again in two weeks for the next follow-up.
Patient: Okay. Have a nice day!
Doctor: You too. Take care.



Doctor: Good afternoon! How have you been since your last visit?
Patient: Good afternoon, Doctor. The stomach pain has reduced a lot.
Doctor: That’s a good sign. Any issues with digestion or appetite?
Patient: My appetite is back, but I still feel bloated after meals.
Doctor: That could be due to gas. Are you avoiding spicy food as advised?
Patient: Yes, I’ve been eating very light.
Doctor: Good. I’ll prescribe a mild antacid. (writes prescription)
Patient: Thank you, Doctor.
Doctor: Keep monitoring how you feel after eating. If the bloating continues, we’ll do an ultrasound.
Patient: Okay, I’ll note it down.
Doctor: See you in ten days for a review.
Patient: Sure. Thanks again!
Doctor: Take care and stay hydrated.


Doctor: Hello! How’s your blood pressure been lately?
Patient: Hello, Doctor. It’s been more stable these past few days.
Doctor: Great. Have you been checking it at home?
Patient: Yes, twice a day as you told me.
Doctor: Excellent. Any dizziness or headaches?
Patient: No, I’ve been feeling fine.
Doctor: That’s a good sign. Are you walking every day?
Patient: Yes, 30 minutes every morning.
Doctor: Perfect. Keep it up and continue your medication.
Patient: Will do, Doctor.
Doctor: We’ll do a full check-up next month.
Patient: Alright. Thank you.
Doctor: You're welcome. Take care of your diet and avoid too much salt.
Patient: Sure. See you next time!


Doctor: Hi there! Still coughing or has it improved?
Patient: Hello, Doctor. The cough is almost gone now.
Doctor: That’s good. Any fever or sore throat left?
Patient: No fever, but my throat feels a little dry sometimes.
Doctor: That’s common after a cold. Drink warm water and avoid cold drinks.
Patient: Okay, I’ll be careful.
Doctor: Did you finish the antibiotics course?
Patient: Yes, I took all five days as you told me.
Doctor: Good job. I’ll give you a throat lozenge for dryness.
Patient: Thank you.
Doctor: No problem. You’re recovering well. Rest properly and avoid dust.
Patient: I will, Doctor.
Doctor: Come back if the symptoms return.
Patient: Sure. Thanks for everything!
Doctor: Take care. Get well soon!



Doctor: Good morning. How are you feeling today?
Patient: Good morning, Doctor. I’ve been feeling very tired lately, especially when I stand up quickly. I also get dizzy sometimes.
Doctor: That sounds like it could be related to low blood pressure. Have you been checking it regularly?
Patient: Yes, I’ve checked a few times at home. It’s usually around 90/60.
Doctor: Alright. Have you made any recent changes in your lifestyle, diet, or medication?
Patient: No major changes. But I’ve noticed that I’ve been gaining weight slowly over the last few months.
Doctor: Any physical activity or regular exercise?
Patient: Not much. My job involves sitting for long hours, and I haven’t had time to work out.
Doctor: Understood. Let me check your vitals.
(checks BP, weight, height, BMI, pulse)
Your blood pressure is low, and your BMI indicates obesity. That could explain the fatigue and dizziness.
Patient: Is it serious?
Doctor: It’s not uncommon, but it needs attention. Here’s what we’ll do:
Increase your salt and fluid intake slightly to help with low BP.
Start with light daily exercise — even a 30-minute walk helps.
Follow a balanced, low-calorie diet plan.
I’ll refer you to a dietitian for a detailed meal plan.
We’ll monitor your BP and weight every 2 weeks.
Patient: Okay, I’ll follow that.
Doctor: Great. We’ll review progress in two weeks. If symptoms worsen, let me know earlier.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. Take care and stay consistent.
